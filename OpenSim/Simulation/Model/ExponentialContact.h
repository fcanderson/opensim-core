// ExponentialContact
//=============================================================================
/** Class ExponentialContact uses an "exponential spring" as a means
of modeling contact of a specified point on a Body with a contact
plane that is fixed to Ground. This specified point is referred to in this
documentation as the "body station". Each ExponentialContact instance
acts at only one body station. In practice, you should choose a number of
body stations strategically located across the surface of a Body,
and construct an ExponentialContact instance for each of those body stations.
For example, if the Body were a cube, you would likely choose the body
stations to be the corners of the cube and construct an ExponentialContact
instance for each corner of the cube (so a total of 8 instances). The contact
plane is typically used to model interactions with a floor, but is not
limited to this use case. The contact plane can be rotated and translated
relative to the Ground frame and so can be used to model a wall, ramp, or
some other planar structure.

Aspects of the exponential contact model are described in the following
publication:

        Anderson F.C. and Pandy M.G. (1999). A dynamics optimization
        solution for vertical jumping in three dimensions. Computer Methods
        in Biomechanics and Biomedical Engineering 2(3):201-231.

Under the covers, the OpenSim::ExponentialContact class encapsulates two
SimTK objects: ExponentialSpringForce and ExponentialSpringParameters.
For the details concerning these classes, see the Simbody API
documentation. A condensed version of that documentation is provided here.

----------------------------------
Computations and Coordinate Frames
----------------------------------
The positive z-axis of the contact plane defines its normal. The positive
z-axis is the axis along which the repelling normal force (modeled using an
exponential) is applied. The x-axis and y-axis of the contact plane together
define the tangent plane. Friction forces will always be tangent to the x-y
plane.

In the equations below, all quantities are expressed in the frame of the
contact plane. A variable with a "z" suffix (e.g., pz, vz, or cz) refers
to a quantity that is normal to the contact plane or that pertains to
calculation of the normal force. A variable with an "xy" suffix
(e.g., pxy, vxy, or cxy) refers to a quantity that lies in or is tangent to
the contact plane or that pertains to calculation of the friction force.

### Normal Force (positive z-axis)

The elastic part of the normal force is computed using an exponential
whose shape is a function of three parameters (d₀, d₁, and d₂):

        fzElastic = d₁exp(−d₂(pz−d₀))

Note that pz is the displacement of the body station above (pz > 0.0)
or below (pz < 0.0) the contact plane. The default values of the shape
parameters were chosen to maximize integration step size while maintaining a
number of constraints (e.g., the normal force should fall below 0.01 Newtons
when pz > 1.0 cm). The damping part of the normal force is linear in velocity
and scaled by the elastic part:

        fzDamping = −cz vz fzElastic,

where vz is the normal component of the velocity of the body station and
cz is the damping coefficient for the normal direction. All together, the
spring force in the normal direction is given by

        fz  = fzElastic + fzDamping
            = d₁exp(d₂(py−d₀)) − cz vz d₁exp(d₂(pz−d₀)))
            = d₁exp(d₂(pz−d₀)) (1 − cz vz)

which has the form of the Hunt & Crossley damping model:

        K. H. Hunt and F. R. E. Crossley (1975). Coefficient of Restitution
        Interpreted as Damping in Vibroimpact. ASME Journal of Applied
        Mechanics, pp. 440-445.

### Friction Force (x-y plane)

The friction force is computed by blending two different friction models.
The blending is performed based on the 'Sliding' State of the
ExponentialSpringForce class.

#### Friction Model 1 - Pure Damping (Sliding = 1.0)
When the body station is sliding with respect to the contact plane, the
friction force is computed using a simple damping term:

        fricDamp = −cxy vxy

where cxy is the damping coefficient in the contact plane and vxy is the
velocity of the body station in the contact plane. The magnitude of the
total frictional force is not allowed to exceed the frictional limit:

        fricLimit = μ fz
        if (|fricDamp| > fricLimit)
            fricDamp = −fricLimit vxy / |vxy| = −μ fz vxy / |vxy|

where μ is the instantaneous coefficient of friction (more below). Note that
fz is always positive and so fricLimit is a positive scalar. Thus, for
velocities in the contact plane above some threshold velocity, which is
typically small (i.e., less than 0.1 m/s), this model is consistent with a
standard Coulomb Friction model.

#### Friction Model 2 - Damped Linear Spring (Sliding = 0.0)
When the body station is anchored with respect to the contact plane, the
friction force is represented by a damped linear spring. The viscous term is
given by the same damping expression as above:

        fricDampSpr = −cxy vxy

and the elastic term is given by

        fricElasSpr = −kxy (pxy−p₀)

where kxy is the friction spring elasticity, pxy is the position of the body
station projected onto the contact plane, and p₀ is the current spring zero
(i.e., the elastic anchor point of the friction spring). Note that p₀ always
resides in the contact plane.

The total friction spring force is then given by the sum of the elastic and
viscous terms:

        fricSpr = fricElasSpr + fricDampSpr

If the magnitude of the fricSpr exceeds the magnitude of the friction limit,
the terms are scaled down:

        if(|fricSpr| > fricLimit)
            scaleFactor = fricLimit / |fricSpr|
            fricDampSpr = scaleFactor * fricDampSpr
            fricElasSpr = scaleFactor * fricElasSpr
            fricSpr = fricElasSpr + fricDampSpr

Scaling down the friction spring force does not alter its direction.

#### Blending the Friction Models
Blending Model 1 and Model 2 is accomplished using linear expressions of the
Sliding State:

        fricElasBlend = fricElasSpr * (1.0 − Sliding)
        fricDampBlend = fricDampSpr + (fricDamp − fricDampSpr)*Sliding
        fricBlend = fricElasBlend + fricDampBlend

Model 1 (Pure Damping) dominates as Sliding → 1.0, and Model 2
(Damped Linear Spring) dominates as Sliding → 0.0.

#### Moving the Friction Spring Zero
The friction spring zero (p₀) (the elastic anchor point) is always altered
to be consistent with the final value of the blended elastic force:

        p₀ = pxy + fricElasBlend / kxy;
        p₀[2] = 0.0;  // ensures that p₀ lies in the contact plane

#### Coefficients of Friction
Coefficients of kinetic (sliding) and static (fixed) friction can be specified
for the spring, subject to the following constraints:

        0.0 ≤ μₖ ≤ μₛ

Note that there is no upper bound on μₛ. The instantaneous coefficient of
friction (μ) is calculated based on the value of the Sliding State:

        μ = μₛ − Sliding*(μₛ − μₖ)

The value of Sliding is calculated using a continuous function of the
ratio of the speed of the elastic anchor point (ṗ₀) to the settle velocity
(vSettle). vSettle is a customizable topology-stage parameter that represents
the speed at which a body station settles into a static state with respect to
the contact plane. See SimTK::ExponentialSpringParameters::setSettleVelocity()
for details. In particular,

        ṗ₀ = |Δp₀| / Δt
        Sliding = SimTK::stepUp( SimTK::clamp(0.0, ṗ₀/vSettle, 1.0) )

where Δp₀ is the change in p₀ and Δt is the change in time since the last
successful integration step. When ṗ₀ ≥ vSettle, Sliding = 1.0, and as
ṗ₀ → 0.0, Sliding → 0.0.

-----------------------
CUSTOMIZABLE PARAMETERS
-----------------------
Customizable Topology-stage parameters specifying the characteristics of the
exponential spring are managed using SimTK::ExponentialSpringParameters.
To customize any of the Topology-stage parameters on an ExponentialContact
instance, you should

1) Create an ExponentialSpringParameters object. For example,

        ExponentialSpringParameters myParams;

2) Use the available 'set' methods in ExponentialSpringParamters to change
the parameters of that object. For example,

        myParams.setNormalViscosity(0.25);

3) Use ExponentialContact::setParameters() to alter the parameters of one
(or many) ExponentialContact instances. For example,

        ExponentialContact spr1, spr2;
        spr1.setParameters(myParams);
        spr2.setParameters(myParams);

4) Realize the system to Stage::Topology. When a new set of parameters is
set on an ExponentialContact instance, as above in step 3, the System will
be invalidated at Stage::Topology. The System must therefore be realized at
Stage::Topology (and hence Stage::Model) before a simulation can proceed.

        system.realizeTopology();

Note that each ExponentialContact instance owns its own private
ExponentialSpringParameters object. The myParams object is just used to set
the desired parameter values of the privately owned parameters object. It is
fine for objects like myParams to go out of scope or for myParams objects
allocated from the heap to be deleted.

Therefore, also note that the parameter values possessed by an
ExponentialContact instance do not necessarily correspond to the values
held by a local instance of ExponentialSpringParameters until a call to
ExponentialContact::setParameters() is made.

The default values of the parameters are expressed in units of Newtons,
meters, seconds, and kilograms; however, you may use an alternate set of
self-consistent units by re-specifying all parameters.

The default values of the parameters work well for typical contact
interactions, but clearly may not be appropriate for simulating many contact
interactions. For the full descriptions of the contact parameters see the
Simbody API documentation for SimTK::ExponentialSpringParameters.

/** This subclass helps manage the topology-stage parameters of the underlying
SimTK::ExponentialSpringForce instance. These parameters (e.g., elasticity,
viscosity, etc.) determine the force-producing characteristics of the
exponential spring force.

This class does 3 things:

- Implements an OpenSim Property for each of the customizable contact
parameters, enabling those parameters to be serialized and de-serialized to
and from an OpenSim Model file.

- Provides a member variable (_stkparams) for storing user-set parameters
prior to the existance of the underlying SimTK::ExponentialSpringForce object.
During model initialization, when the SimTK::ExponetialSpringForce object is
constructed, the user-set properties/parameters are then pushed to that object.

- Ensures that the values held by the OpenSim properties are kept consistent
with the values held by a SimTK::ExponentialSpringParameters object.
Depending on the circumstance, parameters are updated to match properties or
properties are update to match parameters.

To change the values of individual parameters programmatically:
```
    // Get a modifiable copy of the underlying parameter object
    // (`exp_contact` is a instance of ExponentialContact)
    SimTK::ExponentialSpringParameters p = exp_contact.getParameters();

    // Make the desired changes to the copy using the appropropriate setters
    p.setFrictionElasticity(kpNew);
    p.setFrictionViscosity(kvNew);
    ...

    // Call ExponentialContact::setParameters() to push the new parameters
    // to the underlying SimTK::ExponentialSpringForce object.
    exp_contact.setParameters(p);
```
